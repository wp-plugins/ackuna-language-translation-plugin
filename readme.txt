Allows your users to translate your blog into many different languages. The button is added to the top of every post.

== Description ==

A free **translation** button provided by [Ackuna](http://ackuna.com/ "free app translation") allowing visitors to **translate** 
your website into 90 languages. Ackuna is powered by Google Translate and combines all it's translation functionality into one 
small, easy to use button. Once installed, the button will appear at the top of the individual posts.

Ackuna supports over 90 languages.

== Installation ==

1. Upload ackuna-language-translation-plugin to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. If your website is not in English, go to the settings page and select the language from the dropdown menu.
1. If selecting a language has no effect, you may want to check the "use valid jQuery" checkbox. (Caution: may cause conflicts with other plugins or themes.)
1. If you are using any caching plugins, such as WP Super Cache, you will need to clear your cached pages after updating your Translate This settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When will you be adding support for new languages? =

Since the button only uses Google Translate, we have no control of when new languages will be available. Once Google 
does add a new language, we try to add support for that language as quickly as possible.

= Google Translate added a new language, and it's not available through Ackuna. Why is that? =

When Google Translate adds a new language it is not automatically available through Ackuna. This is because we must make internal changes 
to our program telling it the language is available and how to handle it. Also, we need to add a flag image for that language. We make every 
effort to keep the translator's available language list as up to date as possible.
