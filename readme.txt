== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When will you be adding support for new languages? =

Since the button only uses Google Translate, we have no control of when new languages will be available. Once Google 
does add a new language, we try to add support for that language as quickly as possible.

= Google Translate added a new language, and it's not available through Ackuna. Why is that? =

When Google Translate adds a new language it is not automatically available through Ackuna. This is because we must make internal changes 
to our program telling it the language is available and how to handle it. Also, we need to add a flag image for that language. We make every 
effort to keep the translator's available language list as up to date as possible.
